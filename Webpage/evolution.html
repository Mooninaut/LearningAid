        <h2>Translations</h2>
        <p>I originally designed Learning Aid to use text built into the game, so that it would just work in every language WoW itself supports. However, I eventually had to add text of my own.</p>
        <p>Since I only speak and write English, I used a great feature of <a href="http://curseforge.com/" target="curseforge">CurseForge</a>, the <a href="http://wow.curseforge.com/wiki/projects/localizing-your-project/" target="curseforge">localization system</a>. I uploaded the text I wrote in English, and contributors around the world have translated it into their own languages.</p>

      <h1>The Game Changes</h1>
      <p>WoW’s development team was also dissatisfied with the rank system. The third game expansion, World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, released in 2010, <a href="http://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_4.0.1#Classes:_General" title="Patch 4.0.1" target="wiki">removed spell and ability ranks</a>. From then on, spells and abilities have had only one "rank", that increases in power as a character gains levels. The removal of ranks made Learning Aid less essential, but it still remained useful when learning new spells or abilities for the first time, or when changing from one <a href="http://wow.gamepedia.com/Specialization" target="wiki">talent specialization</a> to another, which involves replacing some spells and abilities with others.</p>
      <p>I enhanced Learning Aid for this somewhat altered role by adding a feature that would place relearned spells onto the user’s action bars where they were before they were unlearned, if there was room. I also added an options page, using the AceGui AddOn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_%28computing%29" title="Wikipedia: Library (computing)" target="wiki">code library</a>, to handle laying out and displaying the individual checkboxes and buttons.
      </p>
      <p>I added many of the optional features of Learning Aid in response to requests from users. Users have suggested new features such as integration with other AddOns, functions for specific character classes, and ways to make Learning Aid easier to use, like the “lock” icon to keep it from being accidentally moved. I haven’t gotten to all of the good ones yet, but I’m still making improvements.</p>
      <p>Learning Aid helps with another annoying part of learning spells, abilities and recipes. It adds a “Learn All” button to trainer NPCs to allow the player to purchase all available training at once.</p>
      <div class="paragraph"><p>As Learning Aid grew in complexity, I realized I needed testing and debugging tools. I used the <a href="http://www.wowace.com/addons/ace3/pages/api/ace-config-3-0/" target="addon">AceConfig</a> command-line module to easily add additional debug testing commands as I needed them. My favorite debugging AddOns are:</p>
      <ul><li><a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/hack" target="addon">Hack</a>, a programmer’s notepad and Lua console</li><li> <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/lua-browser" target="addon">LuaBrowser</a>, a visual Lua data exploration tool</li><li><a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bugsack" target="addon">BugGrabber and BugSack</a>, which catch and display errors as they occur.</li></ul></div>
