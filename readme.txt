Learning Aid helps you put new spells, abilities, tradeskills, mounts and minipets on your action bars or in your macros when you learn them, without having to page through your Spellbook or Pets tab.  When you learn something new, Learning Aid pops up a window with an icon for the newly learned action.  You may then drag the icon to your action bar, or use it to paste a link into chat or text into a macro.  You can also use the new action directly by clicking on the icon.  When you're done, you can easily dismiss the window.
