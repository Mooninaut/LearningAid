# 1.07 Completed Features

When the player unlearns a spell or ability due to a talent reset,
remember where on the player's action bars that spell or ability was.
When the spell or ability is relearned, put it back on the player's
action bar in the same place, as long as that slot is empty.

Same as above, but due to a server-side talent reset.

Remember multiple sets of unlearned ability to action bar button
mappings.

Filter "You have learned" and "You have unlearned" spam down to two
lines, saying "You have unlearned A, B, C." and "You have learned X, Y,
Z."

names, such as "Swipe (Bear)".

# Possible

Rewrite entire spell learn / unlearn system to use the system chat
message event instead of caching and diffing.
