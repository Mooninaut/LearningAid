# 1.12a3

results whether or not they were on an action bar, for reals this time.

Added new object-oriented SpellAPI.lua, which may become an independent
library at some point.

Pulled out a lot of obsolete code that has succumbed to bitrot.
There's still a lot left.

Known Issue: If you change specs, all the spec-specific spells for the
spec you didn't start the current game session in will appear. Probably
not that difficult to fix, but it's late and I want to get something at
least semi-functional out tonight.

When the player unlearns a spell or ability due to a talent reset,
remember where on the player's action bars that spell or ability was.
When the spell or ability is relearned, put it back on the player's
action bar in the same place, as long as that slot is empty.

Same as above, but due to a server-side talent reset.

Remember multiple sets of unlearned ability to action bar button
mappings.

Filter "You have learned" and "You have unlearned" spam down to two
lines, saying "You have unlearned A, B, C." and "You have learned X, Y,
Z."
