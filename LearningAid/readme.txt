 Learning Aid helps you put new spells, abilities, and tradeskills on 
your action bars or in your macros when you learn them, without having 
to waste time paging through your Spellbook. When you learn something 
new, Learning Aid pops up a window with an icon for the newly learned 
action. You may then drag the icon to your action bar, or use it to 
paste a link into chat or text into a macro. You can also use the new 
action directly by clicking on the icon. When you're done, you can 
easily dismiss the window.
