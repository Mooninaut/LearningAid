### WoW 5.0.4 / Mists of Pandaria Changes ###

The pet/mount UI has changed so much, and putting pets/mounts on action bars
seems so antiquated when people have hundreds of pets and use addons to manage
them, and pet/mount support in Learning Aid is so buggy that I have removed pet
and mount support.

API changes

New event: PLAYER_SPECIALIZATION_CHANGED fires at the end of the spec swap process

Event changed: LEARNED_SPELL_IN_TAB, global spell id (integer), tab (integer, index 1)

### Learning Aid 1.12 / 2.0 Redesign Work ###

Top down:

1. Show an icon when the player learns an ability AND the ability is not already on their action bar AND they haven't chosen to ignore that ability

  * Detect when an ability is learned
    * Scanning the spellbook
    * Watching events
    * Chat filter
  * Decide whether or not it is "new enough" to display
    * Has it been learned before?
    * Is it on an action bar already?
  * Determine whether the user wants to see it
    * Is it on the ignore list?
    * What does the ignore list really mean?
      * Class abilities
        * Ignore this ability regardless of class
        * Ignore this ability for this class only
        * Ignore this ability for this character only
      * Tradeskill abilities
        * Ignore this ability for all characters
        * Ignore this ability for this character
        * Ignore all ranks of this ability or just this rank
      * Guild abilities
        * Ignore for all characters
        * Ignore for this guild
        * Ignore for this character


### IN PROGRESS ###

got an error while learning Master Riding on the 4.2.0 PTR

test learning pet talents re: spam filter -- NOT WORKING
test unlearning pet talents re: spam filter

clicking a "/usetalents 2" macro while the retalent cast is going on fires a spurious UNIT_SPELLCAST_FAILED_QUIET which fools LA into thinking the talent swap was cancelled

printing newly learned stuff isn't getting triggered, like I just learned Journeyman Mining and the message didn't appear until way way later, after I spent a talent point.
  Same for learning class skills from a trainer -- passes through unmolested
  Learning talents seems to be working

filter tradeskills
  "You have learned how to create a new item: <item>."

AddButton cannot handle flyouts yet

Spam filter: Spells learned from quests?

Learn All does not properly detect when the player's character does not have enough money to buy everything


### DESIGN BLAH ###

51296 = GM cooking
3413 = Expert cooking

spells learned and unlearned
name, link, id -- player spells/abilities

name -- pet spells/abilities

I want to print them out in order

I want to remove stuff that is unlearned then relearned

pets r ez, table.insert(petLearned, name)

--spellsLearned.index[i] = id
spellsLearned.name[id] = name
--spellsLearned.id[i] = id
spellsLearned.link[id] = link

OR

spellsLearned[i] = link -- link contains both id and name

for id, name in pairs(spellsUnlearned.name) do
  if spellsLearned.name[id] then
    spellsLearned.name[id] = nil
    spellsLearned.link[id] = nil
    spellsUnlearned.name[id] = nil
    spellsUnlearned.link[id] = nil
  end
end

later...

I have three data items: id, name, link
I want to de-dupe on id
I want to sort on name
I want to print link

lua sucks

### NEW DESIGN FOR SPELL INFO CACHE ###

part the first: spell info database
  indexed by global id
  invariant information
    spell name
    spell link
    --spell icon -- probably not needed?
    is spell passive?
    possibly whether spell has class/racial/tradeskill/talent/guild origin
    type: tracking (irrelevant, no longer in spellbook, delete option), aura/presence/shapeshift/aspect/stance/form, totem
    is on a flyout?

part the second: spellbook cache
  indexed by spellbook id
    is spell known?
    global id

part the third: spam filter cache
  newly learned
    indexed by id
    sort table (by name)
  newly unlearned
    indexed by id
    sort table (by name)

part the fourth: action bar cache?

### STUFF WHAT IS DONE ###

Stack overflow due to infinite recursion in UpdateIgnoreList -- FIXED IN 1.11.2

figure out how to handle non-class abilities (like mining, herbing, skinning) with the ignore feature, which currently stores ignore information by class -- FIXED IN 1.11.1

rapidly learning multiple pets: first pet (mr chilly) did not show up, subsequent pets (mini thor, core hound pup, warbot) did -- FIXED in 1.11.1

Horked up real good from dropping AceEvent -- FIXED in 1.11.1

fix spam filter for spells with the same name (cat mangle and bear mangle) -- done

fix find missing spells for new cache layout -- done

test unlearning talents re: spam filter -- done

what's going on with call pet? -- DiffSpellBook wasn't handling flyouts correctly

spell_update_cooldown probably not going to work as end signal for retalenting (what if it fires while casting the retalent spell?) instead of player_talent_update
fixed, using unit_spellcast_stop
