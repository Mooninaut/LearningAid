# LearningAid
A User Interface AddOn for World of Warcraft

## Dependencies
Learning Aid depends on the following [Ace3](https://www.wowace.com/addons/ace3/) modules: LibStub, CallbackHandler-1.0, AceGUI-3.0, AceConfig-3.0, and AceConsole-3.0. These must be placed in the "Libs" subfolder.

## What Learning Aid Does

* Displays new spells/abilities when you level up or gain new abilities through other means.
* Searches for spells/abilities that you may have forgotten to add to your action bars.
* Puts unlearned and then relearned talent-based spells/abilities back where they were. 

## What Learning Aid Doesn't Do Yet

* LDB plugin.
* Integration with the base UI's level-up display.
* Filtering of level-up messages.
* Finer-grained control of automatic placement of newly learned spells on action bars, from turning it off to controlling when and where it happens.
* Highlighting options for the spellbook, such as making missing spells stand out in some way. 

## Directions

1. Learn a new spell/ability!
2. Drag it to your action bar!
3. Click the close box to dismiss the window!

You can also shift-click an ability button to create a chat link, just like from the spellbook.

## Options
Right-click on the window's title to lock the window so it does not move.
Learning Aid has a configuration panel in the Interface Options window.
